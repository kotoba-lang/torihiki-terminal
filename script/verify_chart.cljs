(ns verify-chart
  "Opens the deployed terminal and asserts the CHART is drawn, in a browser.

  `verify.cljs` clicks the order form; this one looks at the picture. They are
  different claims and the second is the easier to fake: a chart panel that
  renders its heading and then says nothing is indistinguishable, in the HTML,
  from a chart panel whose data never arrived. The repo has already shipped one
  page that was a picture of itself, so a chart that is a picture of a chart is
  the same mistake one level down.

  The assertions are about the SVG the client swapped in — that it exists, that
  it has candle bodies, that its labels are block heights rather than clock
  times, and that no colour was baked as a hex (which would stop it following
  the theme).
