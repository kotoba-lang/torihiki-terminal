  "Crosses the book on purpose, so there is something for the candle chart to
  draw.

  `verify.cljs` places a POST-ONLY bid below the market: it rests, and a
  resting order is not a fill. The tape only gets an entry when an order
  actually matches, so a chart verified against that session would always be
  verified against an empty tape — which is exactly the shape of hole this
  repo has been bitten by before.

  So: faucet, then a taker buy at the ask. Two sessions, because the
  clearinghouse will not match an account against itself.
