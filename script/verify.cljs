  "Clicks the terminal in a real browser and asserts the chain moved.

  Run against a deployment:

      nbb script/verify.cljs                      # https://torihiki.pages.dev
      TK_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8899 nbb script/verify.cljs

  Playwright resolves from the superproject root, so run it from there or with
  NODE_PATH set. Wrap it in scripts/resource-guard.mjs like any other build.

  ## Why this exists

  The build now refuses to emit a document that does not reference the bundle,
  which would have caught the specific bug that prompted it — the client was
  compiled, deployed, and never loaded, so every panel held the zero frame and
  the status line read 'connecting to the node' forever. But an assertion
  about the HTML cannot tell you the page WORKS. Only clicking it can.

  Everything else was green while it was broken: the build succeeded, the
  bundle was uploaded, the design audit scored 100, and the engine passed 140
  tests. The page was a picture.

  Only the playwright APIs that work under nbb are used: goto,
  waitForTimeout, locator/textContent, fill, click, and `.evaluate` with a
  plain EXPRESSION (an arrow-function string comes back nil here, so nothing
  is inferred from one)."
